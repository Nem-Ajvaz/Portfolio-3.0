        <p>
          Hi I'm Nem, I graduated from RMIT with a Bachelor of Engineering
          (Computing and Networking) in 2017. Since then I have been employed by
          Mondo, a subsidiary of Ausnet Services, who focus on spacial
          enterprise software. I started out as an Application Support
          Technician and gradually moved up to a Team Lead position and now I
          work as a Service Delivery Manager / psuedo Scrum Master.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal for the last year has been to get a full time job as a Scrum
          Master / Agile Coach. I joined University of Sydneys Web Development
          Bootcamp to learn some technical skills and to gain a more intimate
          knowledge of a developers day to day life, which I think will be
          beneficial for a Scrum Master
        </p>
        <p>
          Outisde of work I enjoy playing and watching chess, reading, long
          distance cycling and dabbling in amateur photography.
